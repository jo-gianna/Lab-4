<h2> Biography </h2>
<p> I was raised in the cool cool hills of Malvern, St. Eizabeth. 
It's quite a peaceful place and after I've toiled as a working lady 
for years I would definitely go back to retire in bliss. 
I am currently 20 years of age and am pursuing a Bachelors degree 
in Actuarial Science at the UWI Mona Campus. 
I no longer want to be an actuary though, so I'm searching for my 
calling in this my final year of Undergraduate tertiary studies.
